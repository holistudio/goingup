The goal: Make a simulation of people entering a building to go to a random floor, waiting for an elevator, staying for a while, and then coming back out. Display the environment only in the terminal. 

Had this idea brewing in my head for awhile now, ever since I entered into an elevator and thought about how the programming behind them works. The basic logic of an elevator seems simple enough. Is the current floor the same as a button someone pressed? If so, stop, else...

But what decides which elevator moves to serve the people waiting on each floor? How do the elevators work exactly?

Another part of this idea that attracts me is that the simulation displays everything in the terminal, much like a Multi-User Dungeon haha.

This is meant to be a silly project with no real world applications. But it should be a great learning exercise for:

 - Refreshing myself on how to do objected oriented programming.
 - Practice making the code readable/"professional" - hopefully since my mind isn't totally exhausted on just getting code to work or thinking about the ideas and has time to consider how the code can be more "elegant."
 - Learning C++...after I get this working in Python ;)
